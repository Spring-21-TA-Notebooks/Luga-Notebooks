    "### The Components of a Web Page\n",
    "Before we start writing code, we need to understand a little bit about the structure of a web page. We'll use the site's structure to write code that gets us the data we want to scrape, so understanding that structure is an important first step for any web scraping project.\n",
    "When we visit a web page, our web browser makes a request to a web server. This request is called a GET request, since we’re getting files from the server. The server then sends back files that tell our browser how to render the page for us. These files will typically include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTML — the main part of the page.\n",
    "2. CSS — used to add styling to make the page look nicer.\n",
    "3. JS — Javascript files add interactivity to web pages.\n",
    "4. Images — image formats, such as JPG and PNG, allow web pages to show pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "After our browser receives all the files, it renders the page and displays it to us.\n",
    "There’s a lot that happens behind the scenes to render a page nicely, but we don’t need to worry about most of it when we’re web scraping. When we perform web scraping, we’re interested in the main content of the web page, so we look primarily at the HTML."

The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people.

We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”</p>\n",

       "<p>A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence.

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",
      "—Oliver Azuara Herrera (MPP'02, PhD'11), Economics Officer at the Inter-American Development Bank  \n",
      "“One thing Harris does is give you a really flexible toolkit that can be used in a lot of different ways in the policy arena.”\n",

      "What can I do with a policy degree?\n",
      "Since a public policy degree provides a set of research, analytical, communication, and management skills that are transferable across sectors and issue areas, graduates have flexibility in choosing their career paths.\n",
      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",

      "Since a public policy degree provides a set of research, analytical, communication, and management skills that are transferable across sectors and issue areas, graduates have flexibility in choosing their career paths.\n",
      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",

      "Since a public policy degree provides a set of research, analytical, communication, and management skills that are transferable across sectors and issue areas, graduates have flexibility in choosing their career paths.\n",
      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",

      "Since a public policy degree provides a set of research, analytical, communication, and management skills that are transferable across sectors and issue areas, graduates have flexibility in choosing their career paths.\n",
      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",
      "—Oliver Azuara Herrera (MPP'02, PhD'11), Economics Officer at the Inter-American Development Bank  \n",
      "“One thing Harris does is give you a really flexible toolkit that can be used in a lot of different ways in the policy arena.”\n",

      "What can I do with a policy degree?\n",
      "Since a public policy degree provides a set of research, analytical, communication, and management skills that are transferable across sectors and issue areas, graduates have flexibility in choosing their career paths.\n",
      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

      "Public policy graduates often move back and forth between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, or between international and US-based work. Harris graduates are highly sought-after specifically for their strategic skills, and many have gone on to be social entrepreneurs. Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",
      "A public policy degree can also be beneficial in industries such as energy, health care, finance, transportation, telecommunications, education, or other heavily regulated industries that are impacted by laws or policy outcomes or have a dependency on lobbying and political influence. An understanding of policy can help professionals in those industries as they advance in their careers.\n",

Employers look for graduates to help understand and communicate complex data and information in a way that clearly and concisely supports effective decision-making. In the nonprofit sector, the analytical and program evaluation techniques learned can be useful in demonstrating the impact of an organization's programs, which can be useful for funding, governmental relations, and lobbying efforts.\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",
      "—Eric Tawney (MPP'14), Investment Analyst at BlackRock\n",
      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",

      "“Having attained a master’s of public policy, I have frameworks and tools that I use to formulate responses to complex issues in a deeper and more thoughtful way. The graduate degree in public policy offers an opportunity to step outside of narrow disciplines and learn from and amongst a diverse group of incredibly bright and talented people. I grew significantly as an individual through the friendships I developed and perspectives I gained from my peers. I now have a network across geographies of colleagues in a variety of professional disciplines that I utilize to stay connected to global issues and apply to my personal and professional pursuits.”\n",

      "“My Harris education helps me connect the dots and construct a more comprehensive view of how the Central Bank should produce its policy, including how to maintain low inflation and a stable exchange rate on a national scale. I am, ultimately, impacting my country’s economic policy by bridging the gap between academic research and policy practice.”\n",
      "—Andi Widianto (MPP'11), Economic Analyst at the Central Bank of Indonesia\n",
      "“I think the biggest difference between an economics degree and one in public policy is that those of us with public policy backgrounds better understand the political aspect, the incentives of various stakeholders, and how that impacts policy design and implementation. A lot of policies fail because of competing interests. The advantage that Harris graduates have is that we understand those incentives and interests. We know that it’s about more than just the economic and financial pieces. That informs our work and ultimately matters a lot.”\n",
